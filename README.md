
# 🛡️ Django Vulnerable Web App (Educational Purposes Only)

This project is a deliberately insecure Django web application designed to **demonstrate common web vulnerabilities**. It's ideal for **security training, ethical hacking, CTF practice, and academic use**.

## 📚 Vulnerabilities Demonstrated

| Vulnerability               | Status  |
|----------------------------|---------|
| ✅ SQL Injection            | ✅ Built |
| ❌ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Coming Soon |
| ❌ Command Injection        | Coming Soon |
| ✅ CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) | ✅ Built |
| ❌ Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) | Coming Soon |
| ❌ Path Traversal           | Coming Soon |
| ❌ Open Redirects           | Coming Soon |
| ❌ Insecure Deserialization | Coming Soon |

## 🧪 Example: SQL Injection

We use Django's built-in `auth_user` table to demonstrate SQL Injection.

### 🔓 Vulnerable Endpoint

```http
GET /get_user/?username=' OR '1'='1
```

### 🧨 Raw Query Behind the Scenes

```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM auth_user WHERE username = '{username}'"
```

> This allows attackers to bypass authentication and extract user data.

---
## 🧪 Example: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

We use Django's form submission to demonstrate CSRF vulnerabilities.

### 🔓 Vulnerable Endpoint
```http
POST /transfer/
amount=1000&to_account=attacker
```
🧨 Malicious Form Behind the Scenes
```
    <form method="POST" action="/transfer/">
        <!-- INSECURE: No CSRF protection -->
        <input type="text" name="to_account" placeholder="Recipient's Account" required>
        <input type="number" name="amount" placeholder="Amount ($)" required>
        <button type="submit">Transfer Money</button>
    </form>
```


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Django 5.2.3
- **Database**: SQLite (default)
- **Language**: Python 3.13+

## 🚀 Coming Soon

We will expand the app with more security flaws like:
- Persistent & Reflected XSS
- Remote Command Execution (RCE)=
- Broken Access Control examples (IDOR)
- Path traversal for file access
- Redirect-based phishing tricks
- Deserialization exploits
